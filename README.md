# ADASH Services
ADASH Services is the backend part of [ADASH Cli](https://github.com/xinitrc86/adash-cli). It can be used in conjunction with [ADASH Monitor](https://github.com/xinitrc86/adash-monitor) or any other interface adapted to consume its OData services. 

It consists of:
* An exposed rest API for usage by the cli or other tools. 
* Exposed OData services for usage by the monitor or other interfaces
* A report for job schedulling of tests runs. 

## Usage
Please refer to [ADASH Cli](https://github.com/xinitrc86/adash-cli).

## Installation
* Clone it or import the zip with [ABAPGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit).
  * This will activate ADASH services in /iwfnd/maint_services. Make sure they have a proper system alias after clonning.
  * Expose API in SICF with handler class zcl_adash_sicf_api_handler. 
    * If you wish to change the defult /sap/zadash path, you will need to change zcl_adash_sicf_api_handler with the new path too.
* Schedulle zpr_adash_setup_runner for monitoring.

## Dependencies
Make sure you clone the following repositories before this one.
[zassert](https://github.com/xinitrc86/zassert)
[ABAP Swagger](https://github.com/larshp/ABAP-Swagger)

## Monitoring
Schedule report zpr_adash_setup_runner for an automatic monitoring of your set up packages. We recommend two independent runs:
One without coverage that you can run every 15 minutes (unless somehow all of your tests takes longer than that).
One with coverage that you can run every half a day. Coverage Analyzer can take a long time depending on the amount of code it needs to analyze. Never go below 1 hour runs and keep an eye on your server loads from time to time.


## API
    https://<path_to_your_sys>:<your_sys>/<path to adash sicf node>    
    GET /{type}/{component}/add
    Adds a component to the automatic monitoring, executing a first test run and a first coverage run at the backround. 
    i.e: GET /devc/zpackage/add 
    

    GET /{type}/{component}/test 
    Run tests on given component and return is results. 
    i.e: GET /devc/zpackage/test
